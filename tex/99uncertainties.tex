\section{Uncertainties/mistakes}

\begin{itemize}
\item Something weird in the derivation of \eqref{unc:statmech}.
\item The indices in equation \eqref{unc:indices} seems off.  
\item In the proof in section \ref{unc:proof} i think there should be a creation operator on one of the last lines in the proof, not annihilation operator as it stands in the notes. $a\e^{\varphi a^\dagger}\ket{0}$ instead of $a\e^{\varphi a}\ket{0}$
\item It is a somewhat unclear purpose of ~\Crefrange{unc:expvalN}{unc:expvalN2}. 
\item The ordering of headlines and equations in section \ref{unc:order_boson} is a bit weird, and some things seem a bit unmotivated. 
\item The notes uses partial derivative where one really should use functional derivative. The functional derivative w.r.t the linear sources reduces to regular total derivative, so there is a factor 1/2 difference. 
\item Fixed on the "most important paths" part in feynman path integral. 
\item Double check the labeling on states/ sub indices in \eqref{unc:labeling_on_states} and the previous few eqs. 
\item Justify why one can take the infinitesimal limit on one of the functions in a product in the integral \ref{unc:is_it_really_equal}.

\end{itemize}
